description: How does it work?

The project is setup of a few files. 

[train3.py](mdc:rlbot/train3.py) which is for training the reinforcement learning agent
which defines the environment for the agent and communicates with [RLBotPlugin.java](mdc:runelite/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/rlbot/RLBotPlugin.java). 

[RLBotStateViewer.java](mdc:runelite/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/rlbot/RLBotStateViewer.java) Is used for displaying the state of the app. 


[RLBotPlugin.java](mdc:runelite/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/rlbot/RLBotPlugin.java) these files work together to communicate with the [train3.py](mdc:rlbot/train3.py) module to train the RL agent. I need you to ensure that it works together. 

These are the only files that make up my project as of now.
